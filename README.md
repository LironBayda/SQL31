SQL31

1. 1:n  relationship is a relationship According to which one table called A can relate to several tables and each of these several tables relate only to the one table A
Example- students and class. Each class can has several students and each student can be only to one class
2. We need to define foreign key (PK). The foreign key (PK) need to be unique. In many cases the Primary Key (PK) is the foreign key.
3.  Nested query is a query within another SQL query. We use it when we want to use data from one query in anther query.
4. Increment Auto is a field that can automatically increase the value of a number by one. We should use it because it easier to let SQL to count items and give them numbers. When we delete item the numbers won't change.
5. We can use AS in the SQL query to give the column temporary name.
6. It is a type in which the compiler does not check the type of the variable at compile time, instead of this; it gets the type at the run time. We should use it when we don’t know the type of the variable at compile time like in the case of anonymous class. The risk is that the program can compile with mistakes like calling to fields that doesn’t exist in the dynamic type and crash at run time.
